This project was the design of my first PostgreSQL database from scratch, where I created the schema of a very basic and fictitious database of my university, with disciplines, students and professors.

The schema was made in dbdiagram.io.

The database was created with 4 very simple tables, with few columns and information, where I used them to practice some queries and simple manipulations that can be found in the queries.sql file.

After creating the DB, I tried to learn how to manipulate it using Python, since that's the language I'm learning at the moment.

The result was the manipulations.py file, where I created methods to include/exclude/change records, and also personalized query.
